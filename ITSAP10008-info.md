# Zero Trust Security Model - ITSAP.10.008

![Zero Trust Components](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/EWyt4Xik)

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust (ZT) is a security framework for protecting infrastructure and data. Its central tenet is that no subject (application, user, or device) in an information system is trusted by default. Trust must be re-assessed and verified every time a subject requests access to a new resource.

## The Government of Canada's Zero Trust Security Framework

The Government of Canada (GC) is developing a ZT Security Framework based on the CISA model and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) special publication. This framework includes ZT concepts and components that can be leveraged by departments and agencies to improve the GC’s overall security posture.

## CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) proposes a ZT model that consists of five pillars and three capabilities. This model is designed to provide organizations with a roadmap and resources to achieve an optimal zero trust environment over time.

## Foundation of Zero Trust

The foundation of Zero Trust includes several components:

- **Identity:** Use phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) and continuously validate users and entities throughout their interactions with services or data.
- **Device:** Establish baseline device security protections. Continuously monitor and validate device security.
- **Network/Environment:** Utilize micro-segmentation to isolate critical data from other data. Control privileged network access, manage data flows (internal and external) and encrypt all traffic and connections.
- **Application workload:** Continuously authorize access to applications. Integrate threat protections into application workflows.
- **Data:** Protect data on devices, in applications and in networks. Inventory, categorize and label data, and deploy mechanisms to detect data exfiltration.
- **Visibility and analytics:** Utilize tools like advanced security analytics platforms, and security user behaviour analytics to observe and analyze real-time user behaviour, service and device health.
- **Automation and orchestration:** Automate security and network operational processes by managing functions between all the security systems and applications.
- **Governance:** Automate enforcement of data protections required by policy. Use automated discovery of networks, devices and services with manual or dynamic authorization and automated remediation of unauthorized entities.

## Benefits of Zero Trust

Zero Trust offers several benefits, including increased network security, reduced impact from data breaches, improved data protection, continuous compliance, improved visibility, detection and response, and enabling modernization of the workforce with a secure solution.

## Challenges with Zero Trust

Implementing Zero Trust can pose several challenges, including increased time and effort to authenticate every user and device, increased organizational focus and commitment, and the potential for being locked into a long-term commitment with cloud providers’ proprietary systems.

## Transitioning to a Zero Trust Security Model

To transition to a Zero Trust security model, organizations can enforce strong MFA, grant access based on user and device information, employ just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough access(JEA) risk-based adaptive policies, and use dedicated devices for sensitive tasks.
