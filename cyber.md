## Canada

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) is the main agency responsible for cybersecurity in Canada. They are part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which is Canada's national cryptologic agency.

The CCCS has a strong focus on collaboration and information sharing, and this extends to their open source work. They have contributed to several open source projects and often share threat intelligence with the public and other organizations.

One of their notable open source contributions is Assemblyline. Assemblyline is a scalable distributed file analysis framework that allows an organization to process large volumes of files to identify threats. It was developed by the CCCS and released under an open source license to help other organizations protect their networks.

## USA

In the USA, the National Security Agency (NSA) is one of the main agencies responsible for cybersecurity. They focus on signals intelligence and information assurance.

The NSA has made significant contributions to the open source community. They have released several tools under open source licenses, which have been widely adopted and used by other organizations.

One of their notable open source contributions is Ghidra. Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA's Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code.

Another significant contribution is Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that provide a flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system built into the Linux kernel.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is another agency responsible for cybersecurity in the USA. While they have been less active in the open source space, they do use open source tools and technologies in their work.
