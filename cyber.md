![Comparison Diagram](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/CDubw1Tp)

## Canada

The main cybersecurity agency in Canada is the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS). The CCCS is a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which is Canada's national cryptologic agency. The CCCS is responsible for monitoring and responding to cybersecurity threats to the country. They also provide advice and guidance to help protect critical infrastructure and the private sector.

The CCCS has a strong focus on collaboration and information sharing. They work closely with other government agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions to improve Canada's cybersecurity posture. They also share threat intelligence with the public and other organizations to help them protect their own networks.

In terms of open source work, the CCCS has contributed to several projects. For example, they have released the Assemblyline tool, which is an open-source software that automates the analysis of malicious files, under an open source license. They also promote the use of open source tools and technologies in cybersecurity.

## USA

In the USA, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are two of the main agencies responsible for cybersecurity. The NSA focuses on signals intelligence and information assurance, while the CIA focuses on human intelligence.

The NSA has a strong focus on protecting the government's information systems, preventing foreign adversaries from gaining access to classified national security information. They also work to create standards and guidelines for cybersecurity practices.

The CIA, on the other hand, focuses on gathering and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals in order to help inform the U.S. government's policy decisions.

In terms of open source work, the NSA has made significant contributions. They have released several tools, like Ghidra, a software reverse engineering framework, and Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools for Linux, under open source licenses. The CIA has been less active in the open source space, but they do use open source tools and technologies in their work.
