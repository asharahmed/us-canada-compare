# Future Components of Zero Trust Initiatives in Canada and the USA

![Comparison Diagram](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/QmKLnokN)

## Canada

In Canada, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) has identified several components that are yet to be implemented as part of their Zero Trust initiatives:

- **Real-Time Analytics:** This involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of network activity to detect any suspicious behavior in real-time. This can help to identify and respond to threats more quickly.

- **AI and Machine Learning:** These technologies can be used to automate the detection of threats and anomalies. They can also help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of threat detection.

- **Automated Response:** This involves the use of automation to respond to detected threats. This can help to reduce the time it takes to respond to a threat and minimize the potential damage.

## USA

In the USA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has also identified several components that are yet to be implemented as part of their Zero Trust initiatives:

- **Real-Time Analytics:** Like in Canada, this involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of network activity to detect any suspicious behavior in real-time.

- **AI and Machine Learning:** These technologies can be used to automate the detection of threats and anomalies, improving the accuracy and efficiency of threat detection.

- **Automated Response:** This involves the use of automation to respond to detected threats, reducing the time it takes to respond to a threat and minimizing the potential damage.
