# Zero Trust Initiatives in Canada and the USA

![Comparison Diagram](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/fPqwWkpk)

## Canada

In Canada, the adoption of Zero Trust architecture is still in its early stages. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) has recognized the importance of Zero Trust and has started to provide guidance on its implementation. However, the adoption across the Canadian public sector varies, with some organizations further along than others. The CCCS is working to promote the adoption of Zero Trust and to provide the necessary support and resources.

Key components of Zero Trust architecture currently being deployed in Canada include:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users and devices can access applications and data.
- **Microsegmentation:** Dividing the network into small zones to maintain separate access for separate users.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Limiting user access rights to the minimum permissions they need to perform their work.

## USA

In the USA, the adoption of Zero Trust is more advanced. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a special publication (SP 800-207) on Zero Trust Architecture, providing detailed guidance on its implementation. Furthermore, the Biden administration's Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity has mandated the federal agencies to develop a plan to implement Zero Trust Architecture. This has accelerated the adoption of Zero Trust across the federal government.

- **Microsegmentation:** Dividing the network into small zones to maintain separate access for separate users.
- **Least Privilege Access:** Limiting user access rights to the minimum permissions they need to perform their work.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring and logging all network activity to detect any suspicious behavior.
